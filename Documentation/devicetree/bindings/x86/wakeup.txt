Secondary CPU enable-method "acpi-wakeup-mailbox" binding
===========================================================

This document describes the "acpi-wakeup-mailbox" method for
enabling secondary CPUs.

The ACPI spec defines a merchanism to let the bootstrap processor wake up application
processors with a mailbox. The "acpi-wakeup-mailbox" enable method follows the
"Multiprocessor Wakeup Mailbox Structure" defined in the ACPI spec[1].

This enable method applys to all CPUs and should be defined in the "cpus" node
and will not be defined on each "cpu" node, since the ACPI mailbox structure is
shared by all the CPUs.

* Physical address of the mailbox
The physical address of the mailbox is defined as "wakeup-mailbox-addr"
property. The address must be 4K bytes aligned and it should be in the reserved
memory.
